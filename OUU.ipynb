    "## Polynomial Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial chaos (PC) is the name of an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) method that approximates a function with a polynomial expansion made up of orthogonal polynomials. This function has \\textit{random variables} as inputs, and we are interested in the effects of the random (uncertain) inputs on the output of this function. Statistics of the output can describe the effects of the inputs. We use the polynomial chaos method to efficiently compute these statistics and the gradients of these statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first describe the polynomial chaos method for the case of a 1-dimensional random input and then for the $n$-dimensional random input case. We then discuss two methods---quadrature and regression---to compute the coefficients used in the PC expansion. We finish with an extension of polynomial chaos to compute gradients."

Details about the numerical generation of orthogonal polynomials can be found in~\\citet{Padron2017}.

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "We observe that the tensor product results in summations over all possible combinations of the indices, which results in $\\prod_{k=1}^n m_{i_k}$ function evaluations. If all univariate integrations are of the same order $m_{i_k}=m$, then $m^n$ function evaluations are needed to evaluate the multi-dimensional integral numerically. As mentioned above, this exponential increase with the increase in the number of dimensions $n$ is known as the *curse of dimensionality* and renders tensor product quadrature impractical when $n$ is large. To alleviate the *curse of dimensionality* sparse grid methods have been developed (see below).\n",

    "A commonly used quadrature operator is Gaussian quadrature because for $m$ points (nodes, function evaluations) it can exactly integrate polynomials of degree $2m-1$.\n",
    "For Gaussian quadrature, the nodes locations $\\xi_j$ and the weights $w_j>0$ depend on the domain of integration and the weight (density) function $\\rho(\\xi)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function evaluation is expensive, and when one is performing a convergence study of the integration, it is desired to be able to reuse the quadrature points of the lower order quadrature. A drawback of Gaussian quadrature is that the quadrature points distribution depends on the number of points $m$, i.e., the model evaluations at the nodes $\\xi_j$ for the $m$-point integration cannot be reused in another integration involving a different number of nodes. Nested integration rules overcome this problem by enforcing that the nodes of a given quadrature also feature as nodes of higher-order formulas. The drawback of nested rules is that with $m$ points they can only exactly integrate polynomials up to order $m-1$.\n",
    "In practice, this is not a big drawback as the model $R$ is rarely a polynomial and thus the integrand, \\cref{eq:integrand}, is not polynomial. For this reason achieving the maximum polynomial degree of exactness does not necessarily produce higher  accuracy~\\citep{Trefethen2008}. Examples of nested quadrature are Genz-Keister for normal uncertain variables and Gauss-Patterson for uniform variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparse grids**.\n",
    "Sparse grids is a particular type of quadrature that is based on linear combinations of tensor product quadrature operators that result in a significantly smaller number of nodes (function evaluations) while preserving as high a level of accuracy as tensor product quadrature~\\citep{Gerstner1998,Olivier2010}. The first method to produce sparse grids was proposed by \\citet{Smolyak1963} in the context of multi-dimensional quadrature and interpolation.\n",
    "The sparse grid quadrature method can be written as~\\citep{Eldred2011}\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathcal{S}(l,n) = \\sum_{l+1\\leq |\\mathbf{i}| \\leq l+n} {(-1)}^{l+n-|\\mathbf{i}|}\n",
    "  \\mathbf{i}nom{n-1}{l+n-|\\mathbf{i}|}\\cdot (\\mathcal{U}^{i_1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\mathcal{U}^{i_n}),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $l$ is the level of the sparse grid ($l \\in \\{0, 1 ,2 , \\ldots \\}$). Increasing the level of the sparse grid increases the number of quadrature points. The indices $i_k$ define which quadrature is used for the $k$ dimension. These indices are grouped in the multi-index $\\mathbf{i}=(i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_n)$, for which we define $|\\mathbf{i}|=i_1+i_2+ \\cdots +i_n$. The relationship between the index $i_k$ and the number of quadrature points $m_{i_k}$ is called the growth rule and is dependent on the quadrature rule used. If the quadrature points are chosen based on a nested quadrature rule, then a nonlinear growth rule results, which approximately doubles $m_{i_k}$ with every increment in $i_k$ (e.g., $m_{i_k}=2^{i_k+1}-1$). If the quadrature points are based on a non-nested quadrature rule, then a linear growth rule results, which allows for finer granularity in the number of points used (e.g., $m_{i_k}=2i_k+1$).\n",
