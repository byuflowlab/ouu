    "## 1    Polynomial Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial chaos (PC) is the name of an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) method that approximates a function with a polynomial expansion made up of orthogonal polynomials. This function has \\textit{random variables} as inputs, and we are interested in the effects of the random (uncertain) inputs on the output of this function. Statistics of the output can describe the effects of the inputs. We use the polynomial chaos method to efficiently compute these statistics and the gradients of these statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first describe the polynomial chaos method for the case of a 1-dimensional random input and then for the $n$-dimensional random input case. We then discuss two methods &mdash; quadrature and regression &mdash; to compute the coefficients used in the PC expansion. We finish with an extension of polynomial chaos to compute gradients."

    "The polynomial basis $ {\\{\\phi_i(\\xi)\\}}_{i=0}^p $ is determined by the distribution of the uncertain variable---the polynomial basis is orthogonal with a weight function that corresponds up to a constant to the probability density function of the uncertain variable. Common random (uncertain) variables (Normal, Uniform, Exponential, Beta) have corresponding classical orthogonal polynomials (Hermite, Legendre, Laguerre, Jacobi) [4]. \n",
    "It is necessary to numerically generate orthogonal polynomials for uncertain variables with empirically-determined distributions, such as those obtained from wind conditions, to preserve the optimal convergence property of the polynomial chaos expansion [4]. Also, the use of orthogonal polynomials allows us to analytically compute statistics from the polynomial chaos expansion (section 1.1.1). Details about the numerical generation of orthogonal polynomials can be found in [1]. In addition to the orthogonal polynomials, the other component of the expansion (1) are the coefficients $\\alpha_i$. The coefficients can be computed either by quadrature or regression as described in section 1.3.\n",

    "Once the coefficients are computed, we use the polynomial expansion (1) to inexpensively compute statistics of our function of interest. The mean and variance are a function of the coefficients $\\alpha_i$ and are obtained analytically by integrating the expansion and using the orthogonality of the polynomials. Other statistics such as probabilities can be estimated by sampling the polynomial expansion.\n",

If all univariate integrations are of the same order $m_{i_k}=m$, then $m^n$ function evaluations are needed to evaluate the multi-dimensional integral numerically. As mentioned above, this exponential increase with the increase in the number of dimensions $n$ is known as the *curse of dimensionality* and renders tensor product quadrature impractical when $n$ is large. To alleviate the *curse of dimensionality* sparse grid methods have been developed (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used quadrature operator is Gaussian quadrature because for $m$ points (nodes, function evaluations) it can exactly integrate polynomials of degree $2m-1$.\n",
    "For Gaussian quadrature, the nodes locations $\\xi_j$ and the weights $w_j>0$ depend on the domain of integration and the weight (density) function $\\rho(\\xi)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function evaluation is expensive, and when one is performing a convergence study of the integration, it is desired to be able to reuse the quadrature points of the lower order quadrature. A drawback of Gaussian quadrature is that the quadrature points distribution depends on the number of points $m$, i.e., the model evaluations at the nodes $\\xi_j$ for the $m$-point integration cannot be reused in another integration involving a different number of nodes. Nested integration rules overcome this problem by enforcing that the nodes of a given quadrature also feature as nodes of higher-order formulas. The drawback of nested rules is that with $m$ points they can only exactly integrate polynomials up to order $m-1$.\n",
    "In practice, this is not a big drawback as the model $R$ is rarely a polynomial and thus the integrand, \\cref{eq:integrand}, is not polynomial. For this reason achieving the maximum polynomial degree of exactness does not necessarily produce higher  accuracy [9]. Examples of nested quadrature are Genz-Keister for normal uncertain variables and Gauss-Patterson for uniform variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparse grids**.\n",
    "Sparse grids is a particular type of quadrature that is based on linear combinations of tensor product quadrature operators that result in a significantly smaller number of nodes (function evaluations) while preserving as high a level of accuracy as tensor product quadrature [10, 11]. The first method to produce sparse grids was proposed by [12] in the context of multi-dimensional quadrature and interpolation.\n",
    "The sparse grid quadrature method can be written as [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mathcal{S}(l,n) = \\sum_{l+1\\leq |\\mathbf{i}| \\leq l+n} {(-1)}^{l+n-|\\mathbf{i}|}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $l$ is the level of the sparse grid ($l \\in \\{0, 1 ,2 , \\ldots \\}$). Increasing the level of the sparse grid increases the number of quadrature points. The indices $i_k$ define which quadrature is used for the $k$ dimension. These indices are grouped in the multi-index $\\mathbf{i}=(i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_n)$, for which we define $|\\mathbf{i}|=i_1+i_2+ \\cdots +i_n$. The relationship between the index $i_k$ and the number of quadrature points $m_{i_k}$ is called the growth rule and is dependent on the quadrature rule used. If the quadrature points are chosen based on a nested quadrature rule, then a nonlinear growth rule results, which approximately doubles $m_{i_k}$ with every increment in $i_k$ (e.g., $m_{i_k}=2^{i_k+1}-1$). If the quadrature points are based on a non-nested quadrature rule, then a linear growth rule results, which allows for finer granularity in the number of points used (e.g., $m_{i_k}=2i_k+1$).\n",

    "Lasso has no closed-form solution. Computing the lasso solution is a quadratic programming problem which can be solved with quadratic programming or by more general convex optimization methods [17]. It can also be solved with an efficient method, least angle regression (LAR or LARS), that computes the Lasso solutions for all values of lambda~\\citep{Efron2004}. The best $\\lambda$ can be found via cross-validation (below). For a discussion comparing ridge, Lasso and other regression techniques see~\\citep{Hastie2009}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lasso solution shrinks (compresses) the size of the coefficients and makes some of the coefficients zero, for this reason, these methods are known as compressed sensing methods~\\citep{Mathelin2012,Doostan2011}. They have been applied in polynomial chaos to find sparse solutions~\\citep{Doostan2011} and with some modifications to find sparse solutions adaptively~\\citep{Blatman2011,Jakeman2015} and to introduce a priori information about the solution~\\citep{Peng2014}.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given number of samples $m$ in the linear system \\cref{eq:linearsystemExpanded} we can use cross-validation (below) to pick the best polynomial order $n$ to approximate the response.  We can add additional regression equations to increase $m$ if derivate information is available at the sample points. The additional equations can be beneficial in accurately computing the coefficients~\\citep{Jakeman2015,Peng2016}.\n",

    "Given the training data (a set of samples) $\\mathbf{X}$, $K$-fold cross-validation divides $\\mathbf{X}$ into $K$ sets (folds) $\\mathbf{X}_k$, $k=1,\\dots,K$ of equal size and uses part of the data ($\\mathbf{X}$ with $\\mathbf{X}_k$ removed) to fit the model (construct the PC approximation) and a different part of the data $(\\mathbf{X}_k)$ to test the model.
